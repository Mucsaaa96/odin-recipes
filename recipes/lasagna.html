        <p>This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne
             by the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce,
             with a few tweaks inspired by locals—adjusting the meat,
             wine, and whether to add milk.
             One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential.
             The ragù is simple, with no garlic, herbs, or spices.
             Fresh pasta eliminates the need for pre-boiling.</p>
